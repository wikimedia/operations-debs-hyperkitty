# hyperkitty is not yet supporting python3. Upstream is currently working on
# this matter and should soon provide a python3-only version of hyperkitty
# and drop python2 support.
#
# See https://gitlab.com/mailman/hyperkitty/merge_requests/75 for more
# information. The merge happened into master on commit
# https://gitlab.com/mailman/hyperkitty/commit/0cbffdf139fc7497083f96cb90c5db319ef0ca59
# and hyperkitty 1.2.0 relase will include it.
