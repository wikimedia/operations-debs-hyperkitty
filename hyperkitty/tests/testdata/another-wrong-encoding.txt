Dear Mailman,
     I'm a graduate student (computer science) in University=20
of Nebraska-Lincoln. The Questionnaire for open source testing=20
below is for a paper I'm working on. Hope you can spend=20
five minutes to finish it in your busy time. Any of your=20
effort will be greatly appreciated!

Questionnaire for Open Source Testing
****************************************************
1. What programming language is used in developing your product
"Mailman 1.1":?
****************************************************
2. How many developers were involved in your project?
****************************************************
3. When do you begin to do testing?=20

    b. Functional design Phase=20
    c. Internal Design Phase=20
    d. Implementation Phase=20
    e. After Implementation=20
    Note: Functional design is to describe the features of a system from
      technique-oriented perspective compared with the user-oriented=20
      perspective of requirement analysis. Internal design is to model=20
      the implementation of system, such as class diagrams.

    b. Choose those inputs most likely to cause failure =20
    c. Choose inputs according to your experience =20
    d. Other (specify            )
Answer:
****************************************************
13. If you do coverage control, what percent of the code (lines of code) =
do=20
    you think are covered in your test?
